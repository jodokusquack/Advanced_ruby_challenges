# Advanced Ruby Building Blocks

This is a project from [The Odin
Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/advanced-building-blocks).
In two projects I tried to learn more about the Ruby Programming language
by trying to implement a Bubble Sort algorithm and my owm Enumerable
Module.

Tests were added later when I advanced to the RSpec project from the
curriculum.

To test the methods run
'rspec' in the project
directory after cloning it
onto your machine.
